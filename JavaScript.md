## What is Javascript ?

1. JavaScript is a versatile **Scripting and Programming language** primarily used to make websites interactive and dynamic.

## Scripting and Programming language means

- Scripting languages and programming languages are both used to write instructions that tell a computer what to do. But they differ in how they are executed and what they are used for.

## Scripting languages

**Execution**

    - Scripting languages are interpreted, which means they are executed line by line.

**Use**

- Scripting languages are often used for automation, configuration management, and prototyping.

**Ease of use**

- Scripting languages are generally easier to learn and faster to code than programming languages.

**Examples**

- JavaScript, PHP, Python, Node.js, and Ruby are all scripting languages.

## Programming languages

**Execution**

- Programming languages are compiled, which means they are translated into machine code before being executed.

**Use**

- Programming languages are often used for developing complex software applications.

**Ease of use:**

- Programming languages can have a steep learning curve.

**Examples**

- C, C++, and Java are all programming languages.

2.  It is a language that web browsers understand. When you visit a webpage, your browser can read and execute JavaScript code to create interactive features and functionality on the page.
3.                     Actions:
            Enables interactivity.
         Updates:
              Alters page without reloading.
         Events:
           Responds to user actions.
          Data:
            Fetches and sends info to server.

4.  JavaScript makes the web engaging, dynamic, and user-friendly.

---

    JavaScript is traditionally a synchronous, single-threaded programming language. However, with the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript now supports asynchronous programming, enabling it to handle non-blocking operations efficiently

    JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted, event-driven, and object-oriented programming language that supports key principles such as polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. It is used for both client-side and server-side scripting. For server-side scripting, we use tools like Node.js. JavaScript allows developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages, enhancing the user experience by transforming static pages into engaging, interactive ones.

\*_JavaScript can be executed not only in web browsers but also on servers and any device equipped with a JavaScript engine. This versatility makes it possible to build a wide range of applications, including:_

- Frontend applications
- Backend applications
- Mobile applications
- Desktop applications
- Machine learning solutions
- Game development projects

**Some of the most popular websites and applications built using JavaScript include Facebook, Instagram, Discord, Uber, WhatsApp Desktop app, and Microsoft Teams.**

5. JavaScript can modify both the content (HTML) and the style (CSS) of a webpage. It can handle calculations, manipulate data, and ensure information is entered correctly.

6. It makes web pages dynamic, allowing them to change and respond to user actions in real-time. Unlike compiled languages, JavaScript is interpreted directly by your web browser. The browserâ€™s built-in JavaScript engine takes care of this translation process, enabling the code to run seamlessly.

---

## NOTE

       **JavaScript and  Java are two different languages, each with its own purpose and style.**

\*_JavaScript is mainly used for making websites interactive, like adding
animations or forms that respond when you click. It works in your
web browser._

\*_Java on the other hand is often used for building the backend of websites, handling things like databases and servers._

## History of JavaScript

     1.JavaScript was originally named Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.

     2.JavaScript was created by *Brendan Eich* in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation.

     3.JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning it is executed line by line.

ECMA-(European Computer Manufacturers Association (1997))

**ECMA International is a non-profit organization that develops standards in computer hardware, communications, and programming languages.**

# Variables in JavaScript

Variables in JavaScript are containers used to store data values.

## Syntax for Declaring Variables

# JavaScript Variable Declaration: `var`, `let`, and `const`

JavaScript provides three keywords for declaring variables:

- `var`: Used in older versions of JavaScript.
- `let`: Used for block-scoped variables.
- `const`: Used for variables that cannot be reassigned.

## Examples

### 1. **Using `var`**

`var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared or updated. It is less commonly used in modern JavaScript.

```javascript
var name = "John";
console.log(name); // Output: John

// Redeclaring and updating with `var`
var name = "Doe";
console.log(name); // Output: Doe

// Hoisting with `var`
console.log(age); // Output: undefined (hoisted, but not initialized)
var age = 25;
```

### 2. **Using `let`**

`let` is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared in the same scope. It allows reassignment.

```javascript
let city = "New York";
console.log(city); // Output: New York

// Updating the value
city = "Los Angeles";
console.log(city); // Output: Los Angeles

// Block scope example
if (true) {
  let greeting = "Hello";
  console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello
}
// console.log(greeting); // Error: greeting is not defined
```

### 3. **Using `const`**

`const` is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned or redeclared. It must be initialized when declared.

```javascript
const country = "USA";
console.log(country); // Output: USA

// Attempting reassignment or redeclaration
// country = "Canada"; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
// const country = "Canada"; // Error: Identifier 'country' has already been declared

// Block scope with `const`
if (true) {
  const food = "Pizza";
  console.log(food); // Output: Pizza
}
// console.log(food); // Error: food is not defined

// Using `const` with objects or arrays (mutation allowed)
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
person.age = 31; // Allowed (mutating the object)
console.log(person); // Output: { name: "Alice", age: 31 }

// person = { name: "Bob" }; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

| Feature       | `var`                            | `let`                     | `const`                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Scope         | Function                         | Block                     | Block                             |
| Redeclaration | Allowed                          | Not Allowed               | Not Allowed                       |
| Reassignment  | Allowed                          | Allowed                   | Not Allowed                       |
| Hoisting      | Yes (initialized as `undefined`) | Yes (not initialized)     | Yes (not initialized)             |
| Common Use    | Rare in modern JS                | For variables that change | For constants (unchanging values) |

# JavaScript Case Sensitivity

JavaScript is **case-sensitive**, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different. This applies to variable names, function names, and keywords.

## Key Points

1. **Variable Names**:

   - Variable names are case-sensitive.
   - Example:

   ```javascript
   let myVariable = 10;
   let MyVariable = 20;

   console.log(myVariable); // Output: 10
   console.log(MyVariable); // Output: 20
   ```

2. **Function Names**:

   - Function names must match exactly, including case.
   - Example:

   ```javascript
   function myFunction() {
     console.log("This is myFunction.");
   }

   function MyFunction() {
     console.log("This is MyFunction.");
   }

   myFunction(); // Output: This is myFunction.
   MyFunction(); // Output: This is MyFunction.
   ```

3. **Object Properties**:

   - Object property names are case-sensitive.
   - Example:

   ```javascript
   const person = {
     name: "Alice",
     Name: "Bob",
   };

   console.log(person.name); // Output: Alice
   console.log(person.Name); // Output: Bob
   ```

4. **Keywords**:

   - JavaScript keywords are case-sensitive.
   - Example:

   ```javascript
   let for = 10; // Error: Unexpected token 'for'
   let For = 10; // Allowed (not a keyword)
   ```

5. **Built-in Objects and Methods**:

   - JavaScript built-in objects and methods must use the correct case.
   - Example:

   ```javascript
   console.log(Math.PI); // Output: 3.141592653589793
   console.log(Math.pi); // Output: undefined
   ```

6. **Event Names**:

   - Event names are also case-sensitive.
   - Example:

   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener("click", function () {
     console.log("Clicked!");
   });

   document.addEventListener("Click", function () {
     console.log("This won't work!");
   });
   ```

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing Variable Names**:

   - Using the wrong case will cause an error.

   ```javascript
   let myData = 100;
   console.log(mydata); // Error: mydata is not defined
   ```

2. **Incorrect Built-in Names**:

   - Using the wrong case for built-in objects or methods.

   ```javascript
   console.log(Math.pi); // Output: undefined (should be Math.PI)
   ```

3. **Function Name Mismatch**:

   - Function calls must match the exact name and case.

   ```javascript
   function myFunc() {
     console.log("Hello!");
   }

   myfunc(); // Error: myfunc is not defined
   ```

---

## Best Practices

- **Be Consistent**:
  Use the same naming style (e.g., camelCase) for variables and functions.

- **Check Built-in Names**:
  Refer to documentation for correct capitalization of built-in objects and methods.

- **Avoid Reserved Words**:
  Do not use keywords or similar names (e.g., `for` vs `For`).

---

## JavaScript's case sensitivity can lead to errors if you're not careful. Always double-check variable names and built-in methods to ensure they match exactly.

# Naming Conventions in Programming

Apart from the strict rules of programming languages, there are also **conventions**. These are widely accepted standards followed by most developers to maintain consistency and readability in code.

Naming conventions are especially important as programmers need to name various entities, such as variables, functions, classes, methods, and interfaces.

Over the years, developers have adopted different case types for naming. The most popular ones are:

- **Camel Case**
- **Snake Case**
- **Kebab Case**
- **Pascal Case**

## Naming Case Examples

### Camel Case

- Starts with a lowercase letter.
- Each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.

Examples:

```javascript
firstName;
lastName;
userAccount;
```

### Snake Case

- All letters are lowercase.
- Words are separated by underscores (`_`).

Examples:

```javascript
first_name;
last_name;
user_account;
```

### Kebab Case

- All letters are lowercase.
- Words are separated by hyphens (`-`).

Examples:

```javascript
first - name;
last - name;
user - account;
```

### Pascal Case

- Each word starts with an uppercase letter.

Examples:

```javascript
FirstName;
LastName;
UserAccount;
```

Using consistent naming conventions improves code readability and helps teams collaborate effectively.
